### Problem our app going to address: -
Finding a home whenever you move to a new place is really hectic task. We need to consider several things like housing cost, property type, locality, building amenities, utility amenities etc., Our app is going to address this issue by listing all the apartments available in the selected locality with filters we select like price range, number of bedrooms, property type etc., After submitting this information the contact information of owner is displayed for scheduling a visit to his home.

### Activities that will be created: -
- A login screen for the users.
- A screen for selecting the filters of desired home.
- A screen showing the filtered result.
- A screen for contacting the owner of home.

### Persisted Data: -
Owner upload the pictures of vacant house through his mobile and it will be stored in a database. Location can be detected through GPS. Using filters such as Location, Price range, number of bedrooms they can find the required apartment.
